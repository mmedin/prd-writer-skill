# prd-writer — Cursor Agent Skill

A Cursor agent skill that generates structured PRD (Product Requirements Document) systems optimized for AI coding agents.

Given a product idea or an existing brief, the skill produces four interconnected documents ready to feed directly into Cursor's agent for implementation.

## What It Generates

The skill creates a `docs/` folder in the target project with:

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `prd.md` | Main PRD: vision, users, features, scope, constraints |
| `technical-specs.md` | Data model, API boundaries, integrations, security |
| `user-stories.md` | User stories with acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then) |
| `epics-and-tasks.md` | Epics and granular tasks ready for agent execution |

### Document Hierarchy

```
prd.md (Features F-001..F-NNN)
  → technical-specs.md (references Features by ID)
  → user-stories.md (Stories US-001..US-NNN, linked to Features)
    → epics-and-tasks.md (Epics EP-001..EP-NNN → Tasks T-001..T-NNN)
```

Every task traces back to a user story, which traces back to a feature. IDs are consistent across all documents.

## Installation

The `skill/` directory in this repo is the distributable unit. Copy it to one of the two supported locations:

### Option A: Personal (available across all your projects)

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.cursor/skills
cp -r skill/ ~/.cursor/skills/prd-writer
```

### Option B: Per-project (shared via repository)

```bash
mkdir -p <your-project>/.cursor/skills
cp -r skill/ <your-project>/.cursor/skills/prd-writer
```

No dependencies. No build step. Just copy the folder.

## Usage

The skill activates automatically when Cursor's agent detects you want to write a PRD or start a new project. You can also invoke it manually:

1. Open the agent chat in Cursor.
2. Type `/prd-writer` or describe what you want to build.
3. The skill will either interview you or analyze a document you provide.

### With No Input Document

The skill conducts a structured interview covering: product vision, target users, value proposition, scope, success metrics, constraints, and key user journeys.

### With an Input Document

Attach or reference a brief, one-pager, meeting notes, or existing spec. The skill will:

1. Parse the document and map content against required fields.
2. Validate what's present (flag ambiguities, contradictions, gaps).
3. Ask only for what's missing or unclear.
4. Generate the full document system preserving your terminology.

## Design Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Target agent | Cursor | Optimized for IDE-native agent workflows |
| Scope | Greenfield projects | Templates assume new product definition |
| Output | 4 interrelated documents | Separation of concerns; each serves a different stage |
| Interaction | Hybrid (draft, feedback, refine) | Balances speed with accuracy |
| Task granularity | Agent-ready tasks | Each task completable in a single agent session |
| Tech stack | Agnostic | Skill never prescribes technology |
| Input handling | Gap analysis + validation | Asks only what's missing from provided docs |
